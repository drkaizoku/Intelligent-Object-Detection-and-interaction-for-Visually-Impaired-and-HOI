Human beings find it easy to identify the object or artifact in a picture or photograph. 
Although the task is intricate, it requires minimal human effort. As computer vision mimics the visual system of humans, 
computers can achieve similar results with a combination of extensive data, powerful GPUs, and advanced algorithms.

AI is applied in various areas of image processing like image compression, segmentation, enhancement, and object recognition. 
These pre-trained models assist researchers in gaining a clear understanding of the usage of algorithms in their projects. 
If a researcher has a low-spec device, they can still achieve similar goals by using a mini version of the algorithm, even though image detection and rendering may be compromised. 
This report delves into the interaction of objects in addition to focusing on object detection, bridging the gap between detection cycles. 
Numerous large corporations, which possess vast collections of various data such as images, videos, and audio files, 
are endeavoring to develop an advanced Artificial Intelligence system in order to lessen the burden on humans. 
Giving computers an intelligence system is a significant advancement for the future, as they can multitask efficiently.
